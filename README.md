# Panel Data Analysis Project

Welcome to the repository for my panel data analysis project! In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of economic growth using panel data across various income groups and regions. The goal was to uncover insights into the relationships between different economic factors and growth dynamics.

## Project Overview

In this project, I investigated two key studies:

**Study 1: Impact of Foreign Debt on Economic Growth**
- Explored the relationship between foreign debt and economic growth across lower income, lower middle income, and upper middle income countries.
- Utilized a panel data approach to account for both cross-sectional and time-series variations.
- Analyzed data spanning 25 years (1997-2021) from 66 countries sourced from the World Bank.
- Investigated how various economic indicators influenced economic growth within these income groups.

**Study 2: Impact of Remittances on Economic Growth in South Asian Countries**
- Examined the role of remittances in driving economic growth within South Asian countries.
- Applied panel data analysis techniques to understand the dynamics between remittances and economic growth.
- Used data from multiple years to capture trends and patterns across the South Asian region.

## Methodologies and Tools

Throughout the project, I employed a range of methodologies and tools, including:

- ARDL (Autoregressive Distributed Lag) models for dynamic analysis.
- Stationarity tests to ensure data suitability for analysis.
- Pooled OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) for aggregated data.
- Fixed Effect Models to control for individual-specific effects.
- Random Effect Models to capture both individual and time-specific effects.

The analyses were conducted using Stata software to ensure accurate and robust results.

## Findings

**Study 1:**
- Identified that total debt service, external debt stocks, inflation, and population growth negatively impacted economic growth.
- Discovered that Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflow positively contributed to growth across income groups.

**Study 2:**
- Found that remittances had a positive influence on economic growth within South Asian countries.
- Highlighted the significance of remittances and FDI inflow in driving economic growth, subject to country-specific conditions.
